# ✈️ **README: Airline Price Analysis Project** 🌍

## 🛫 **Project Overview**
Welcome to the **Airline Price Analysis Project!** In this project, you work for a **travel agency** and need to understand the **ins and outs of airline prices** to ensure that clients get the **best deals** on their flights.

Your goal is to explore how **airline prices fluctuate** based on different **factors** and to uncover valuable insights to help customers make **informed travel decisions**.

## 📊 **Dataset Features**
The dataset contains several key factors that influence airline prices:

- ✈️ **miles**: Distance traveled during the flight.
- 👥 **passengers**: Number of passengers on the flight.
- ⏳ **delay**: Take-off delay in minutes.
- 🍽️ **inflight_meal**: Is there a meal included?
- 🎬 **inflight_entertainment**: Are free entertainment systems available for each seat?
- 📶 **inflight_wifi**: Is complimentary WiFi provided?
- 📅 **day_of_week**: The day of the week the flight took place.
- 🏖️ **weekend**: Did this flight take place on a weekend?
- 💺 **coach_price**: The average price paid for a coach ticket.
- 🏆 **firstclass_price**: The average price paid for a first-class seat.
- ⏰ **hours**: Duration of the flight in hours.
- 🌙 **redeye**: Was this an overnight (redeye) flight?

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
- Explore the dataset and understand each feature.
- Identify **patterns and trends** in airline pricing.
- Investigate how factors like **weekend flights, inflight services, and delays** impact pricing.
- Create **visualizations** to effectively communicate insights.

## 📌 **Getting Started**
You will be working in the **script.py** file to explore the dataset. A **solution.py** file is available for reference, but it's best to complete the project on your own before checking it.

## 📊 **Plotting & Visualization Tips**
To ensure plots appear correctly, **use the following code** after each visualization:
```python
plt.show()  # Show the plot
plt.clf()   # Clear the plot
```

Clearing the plot will **not erase** previous plots—it will simply create space for the next visualization.

## 🚀 **Final Thoughts**
There's no single **"correct"** way to analyze this dataset—be **creative** in your exploration! Use different methods to uncover insights and **improve your understanding of airline pricing trends.**

Happy coding and happy flying! ✈️🌍
